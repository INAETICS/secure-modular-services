# securing modular services with KP-ABE
=====

**Abstract**:

Research project involving the integration of [Key Policy Attribute Based Encryption](https://gnunet.org/sites/default/files/CCS'06%20-%20Attributed-based%20encryption%20for%20fine-grained%20access%20control%20of%20encrypted%20data.pdf) into the existing INAETICS modular service architecture. This Proof of Concept uses the [Amdatu Remote services](https://amdatu.org/application/remote/) project to simulate the core principles of INAETICS.
